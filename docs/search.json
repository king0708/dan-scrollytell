We focused on identifying digital assets that track the numbers, location, and changes in populations of living organisms as those are most relevant to biodiversity monitoring.\n\n\n\n\nWe use this assessment to identify key gaps in the current portfolio of digital assets and highlight opportunities to improve technology that would advance biodiversity monitoring by increasing digital assets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe found that digital assets primarily come from satellite observations and monitor terrestrial systems at the community or ecosystem level.\n\n\n\n\nAssets have been doubling roughly every 10 years, and diversifying as new infrastructure has been developed.\n\n\n\n\nThe temporal resolution of assets is typically higher than their latency, meaning there are substantial delays between data collection and data availability.\n\n\n\n\nOver 50% of assets with daily or higher temporal resolution require more than a month to become available after observations were made, and the majority of assets (70%) with annual or multi-year resolution take more than a year to become available to potential users.\n\n\n\n\nThe taxonomic resolution of existing assets is extremely coarse and taxonomic coverage is heavily skewed towards monitoring primary producers. Roughly 81% of assets only identify organisms to Phylum or Kingdom, and 94% of those assets monitor plants or phytoplankton.\n\n\n\n\nOf the major taxa examined, vertebrates (phylum Chordata) have the most complete coverage of species, with 76% of species having at least one digital asset.\n\n\n\n\nIn contrast, only 13% of arthropods species, the most speciose animal phylum, have a digital asset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach square represents one asset."
